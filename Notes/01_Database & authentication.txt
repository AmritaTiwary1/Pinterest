* first , I make two model(collection) in database -- install mongoose,then connect it to local mongodb compass
 1.userModel (to store user info)
 2.postmodel - to store post info

*for authentication -- passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose
module is used ,did setup in app.js, and use functionality in index.js
* we have to add(require,setup) express session in code so that we can use passport session

==> var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

const expressSession= require('express-session')
const passport = require('passport');

 app.use(expressSession({  // here we add express session in code so that we can use passport session
  resave:false,
  secret:'radhe radhe',
  saveUninitialized:false
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session()); //we are using session of passport here
passport.serializeUser(usersRouter.serializeUser());
==> passport.deserializeUser(usersRouter.deserializeUser());



to show any error that occured in login/register(username/password incorrect..etc) , when login,register fn. gives error, we can access those error in flash
=> connect-flash is used to access error of login/register
install connect-flash module, and do setup in app.jsx
now, use flash in login,register route(post)
to show error in login,register page(get) -- send req.flash("error") while rendering the page


now, making profile page dynamic according to the user --
first we have to find user details then we will show that in profile page

** IMPORTANT : when a user is logged in in any website, in the session(storage in server side) -- user all detail is stored as object , since we are using passport for login/register , so we will request session.passport.user
since, if anyone is tring to go to profile page, he must be logged in( bcoz profile is protected route --must satisfy isLoggedIn fn)
so,when user is login, they can open profile page, and session will store user info after login till logout
here, we can access session value in profile route by ___
      req.session.passport.user
 we want to access whole document of that user which was stored in usermodel at time of login/register

 so ---- router.get('/profile', isLoggedIn ,async function(req,res,next){
    const user = await userModel.findOne({
        username:req.session.passport.user
    })
    res.render("profile" , {user}); //we get document of user which is stored in database in user variable (IMPORTANT : req.session.passport.user return user (ie. if i am using this web ,i will get my userinfo, if dev is using this web, he will get his userdata) )
});
